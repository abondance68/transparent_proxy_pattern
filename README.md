# **Sample Hardhat Project**

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract <br>
 and a script that deploys that contract to the goelir network.<br>

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test


yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli 

```
<br>


**The first implementation contract to be deployed on goerli  is the Box.sol contract**<br>
**The second implementation to be deployed on goerli is the ProxyAdmin contract**<br>
**The third  implementation to be deployed on goerli is the TransparentProxy contract**<br>

Those 2 last contracts are verified on goerli.etherscan.io but not the first one.<br>

Once done, go to your cli  and enter the hardhat console by typing :<br> 

```
npx hardhat console --network goerli 
```
Once in the hardhat console,  type: 

```
const Box  = await ethers.getContractFactory("Box")
const box  = await Box.attach("....address of the deployed TransparentProxy contract on goerli.....") 
(await box.retrive()).toString()
```

The result should indicate : '42'
