# **Sample Hardhat Project**

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract <br>
 and a script that deploys that contract to the goelir network.<br>

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test


yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli 

```

**The first implementation contract to be deployed on goerli  is the Box.sol contract**<br>
**The second one to be deployed on goerli is the ProxyAdmin contract**<br>
**The third one to be deployed on goerli is the TransparentProxy contract**<br>

Those 2 last contracts are verified on goerli.etherscan.io but not the first one.
