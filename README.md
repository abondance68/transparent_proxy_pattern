# **Sample Hardhat Project**

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract <br>
 and a script that deploys that contract to the goelir network.<br>

Try running some of the following tasks:

```
npx hardhat test
```
Deploy the contract to the testnet of your choice by changing the values in hardhat.config.js (in our example below
we deploy to goerli) : <br> 
``
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli 

```
<br>


**The first implementation contract to be deployed on goerli  is the Box.sol contract**
**The second implementation to be deployed on goerli is the ProxyAdmin contract**
**The third  implementation to be deployed on goerli is the TransparentProxy contract**

Those 2 last contracts are verified on goerli.etherscan.io but not the first one.

Once done, go to your cli  and enter the hardhat console by typing :<br> 

```
npx hardhat console --network goerli 
```
<br>

**Once in the hardhat console,  type:** 


```
const Box  = await ethers.getContractFactory("Box")<br>
const box  = await Box.attach("....address of the deployed TransparentProxy contract on goerli.....")<br>
(await box.retrive()).toString()

```

The result should indicate : '42'
